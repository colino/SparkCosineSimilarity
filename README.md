# Spark Cosine Similarity

This is a script that takes in input a matrix and calculate for each vector in the matrix the cosine similarity with other vectors


# Example:

```
*add test dataset (dataset.txt) into hadoop hdfs
```


this is in excerpt of dataset:

```
"16",45,12,7,2,2,2,2,4,7,7
"28",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"35",28,9,6,1,0,3,0,5,2,2
"52",28,7,3,3,3,1,2,4,4,3
"63",17,5,1,0,0,0,0,4,1,1
"67",35,20,10,1,1,8,0,17,8,4
